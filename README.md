AKA Proper Handling Physics.



## 0.1 test build FAQ
> Q: What vehicles need testing and feedback?

Primarily Emperor, Blista, Patriot, Vigero, Dominator, Comet, Coquette, Elegy RH, 9F, Bullet, Zentorno and T20.
Pick at least four (or more) drive them around, and report back on grip, cornering, acceleration and overall feel.

> Q: Can I use Inverse Torque while testing?

No, unscripted testing is prioritary. You can use 4.0 with the overhaul for your own enjoyement and additional feedback with it.

## The files for 0.1 (test build)
In the releases page to the right of this text. Labeled, you guessed it, 0.1 (test build). 

Includes:
- handling.meta and the DLCPack for non-day-1 vehicles like the Zentorno and T20.
- Inverse Torque 4.0. You don't need it, but it's a good extra. 4.0 is specifically balanced for this overhaul.
